# Composers

Who doesn't love Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. But today, you're in it to learn more about a new classical composer. This gem will give you the option of first choosing a letter from the alphabet to narrow down your choices. Then you get to choose which composer you'd like to learn more about - once you settle on your choice, you'll get a chance to read about their biography, birth year, notable works and a url to learn more!
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'composers'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install composers

## Usage

Wanna learn more about a classical composer? Well, then have a go! Type a letter from the alphabet, choose a composer whose name starts with the letter you chose and finally, learn more about a specific composer of your choice! Yipee!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
